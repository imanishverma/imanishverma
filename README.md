Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Manish Verma, and I'm passionate about creating test automation frameworks for API, web, and mobile applications. With years of experience in the field, I have honed my expertise in designing efficient and scalable solutions for automating enterprise systems.

Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by learning Kotlin and Golang to enhance my app and backend development skills. I believe in continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies in the ever-evolving world of software development.

I'm always open to collaborating on projects that involve creating innovative and scalable solutions. Let's work together to create cutting-edge automation frameworks that drive results!

Feel free to connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/imanishverma) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/imanishverma/). I'm excited to network and share ideas with fellow professionals in the field. Let's make great things happen! ðŸš€
